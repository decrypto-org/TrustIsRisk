\begin{sepproof}{Proof of Theorem \ref{saturation}: Saturation} \ \\
  From the flow definition we know that
  \begin{equation}
  \label{saturation:flowleqcap}
    \forall i \in [n], x'_i \leq c'_i \enspace.
  \end{equation}
  In turn $j-1$, there exists some valid flow $Y$ such that
  \begin{equation*}
    \forall i \in [n], y_i = c'_i
  \end{equation*}
  with a flow value $\sum\limits_{i=1}^{n}y_i$, which can be created as follows: We start from $X$ and for each
  $\left(A, v_i\right)$ edge we reduce the flow along paths starting from this edge for a total reduction of $x_i - c'_i$ on
  all those paths. $Y$ is also obviously valid for turn $j$ and, since all capacities $c'_i$ are saturated, there can
  be no more outgoing flow from the source, thus $Y$ is a maximum flow in $\mathcal{G}_j$.
\end{sepproof}
