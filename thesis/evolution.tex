\section{Evolution of Trust}
  \subimport{thesis/definitions/}{turns.tex}
  We use $prev\left(j\right)$ and $next\left(j\right)$ to denote the previous and next turn respectively played by
  $Player(j)$. A formal definition can be found in the Appendix.

  Knowledge of the initial graph $\mathcal{G}_0$ and the history amount to full comprehension of the evolution of the
  game. Building on the example of figure \ref{fig:utxo}, we can see the resulting graph when $D$ plays
  \begin{equation}
  \label{turnexample}
     Turn_1 = \{Steal\left(1, A\right), Add\left(4, C\right)\} \enspace.
  \end{equation}

  In the form presented here, TrustIsRisk is controlled by an algorithm that chooses a player, receives the turn that
  this player wishes to play and, if this turn is valid, executes it. These steps are repeated indefinitely. We assume
  players are chosen in a way that, after her turn, a player will eventually play again later.
  \subimport{thesis/algorithms/}{trustisriskgame.tex}
  \texttt{executeTurn()} checks the validity of \texttt{Turn} and substitutes it with an empty turn if invalid.
  Subsequently, it creates the new graph $\mathcal{G}_j$ and updates the history accordingly. For the routine code,
  see the Appendix.
