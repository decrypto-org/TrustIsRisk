Let $A \in \mathcal{V}$ source, $B \in \mathcal{V}$ sink. For the following, we suppose that $Turn_{j-1}$ has just finished
and $A = Player\left(j\right)$ is currently deciding $Turn_j$. We use the following notation:
\begin{align*}
   C \mbox{ capacity configuration with } c_{Av} &= DTr_{A \rightarrow v, j-1} \\
   C' \mbox{ capacity configuration with } c'_{Av} &= DTr_{A \rightarrow v, j}
\end{align*}
Moreover, $X$ and $X'$ will be the flows returned by some execution of
$MaxFlow_{\mathcal{G}_{j-1}}\left(A, B\right)$ and $MaxFlow_{\mathcal{G}_j}\left(A, B\right)$ respectively.

Furthermore, we suppose an arbitrary ordering of the members of $N^{+}\left(A\right)$. We set $n = |N^{+}\left(A\right)|$.
Thus
\begin{equation*}
   N^{+}\left(A\right) = \{v_1, ..., v_n\}
\end{equation*}
We use these subscripts to refer to the respective capacities (a.k.a. direct trusts) and flows. Thus
\begin{equation*}
   \begin{array}{l}
      x_i = x_{Av_i} \enspace, \\
      c_i = c_{Av_i} \enspace,
   \end{array}
   \mbox{ where } i \in [n]
\end{equation*}
