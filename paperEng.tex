  \begin{abstract}
     Reputation in centralized systems uses stars and review-based trust. Such systems require manual intervention and
     secrecy to avoid manipulation. In autonomous and open source decentralized systems this luxury is not available.
     Previous peer-to-peer reputation systems do not allow for financial arguments pertaining to reputation. We propose a
     concrete sybil-resilient decentralized reputation system in which direct trust is defined as lines-of-credit using
     bitcoin's 1-of-2 multisig. We introduce a new model for bitcoin wallets in which user coins are split among trusted
     associates. Indirect trust is subsequently defined transitively. This enables formal game theoretic arguments pertaining
     to risk analysis. We prove that risk and max flows are equivalent in our model. Our system allows for concrete financial
     decision on the monetary amount a pseudonymous party can be trusted with. Through algorithmic trust redistribution, the
     risk incurred from making a purchase from a pseudonymous party in this manner remains invariant.

  \section{Introduction}
     Modern marketplaces can be roughly categorized as centralized and decentralized. Two major examples are
     \href{http://www.ebay.com}{ebay} and \href{https://openbazaar.org/}{OpenBazaar}. \href{http://www.ebay.com}{ebay} is
     centralized and as such it is vulnerable to ddos attacks \cite{ddosattacks} and can be considered as a single point of
     failure, it charges fees for the use of its services \cite{ebayfees} and maintains a private database of personal data,
     but it can give money-back guarantees \cite{ebayguarantee} since it is run by a single company that has a financial
     advantage in keeping its clients satisfied. On the other hand, \href{https://openbazaar.org/}{OpenBazaar} is a
     decentralized platform built on bitcoin \cite{bitcoin}, where individual stores or its \href{https://duosear.ch}{search
     engine} are vulnerable to ddos attacks \cite{ddosattacks}, but not the platform as a whole. Additionally, it does not
     charge fees for its usage \cite{openbazaar} and there is no central agent recording all the transactions alongside with
     private data \cite{openbazaar} but it is possible for a buyer or a seller colluding with a  moderator to scam the third
     party and there exists no central authority able to verify the truth of her claim and reimburse her
     \cite{multisigfraud}. Even though trust (or distrust) should be directed to each store individually, it is very likely
     that the whole platform will be discarded as untrusted by the scammed party.

     Our goal is to create a distributed marketplace where the trust each user gives to the rest of the users is
     quantifiable, measurable and expressable in monetary terms. The central concept used throughout this paper is
     trust-as-risk, or the proposition that a user's $A$ \textit{trust} to another user $B$ is defined to be the
     \textit{maximum sum of money} $A$ can lose when $B$ is free to choose any strategy she wants. To flesh out
     trust-as-risk, we will use \textit{lines of credit} as proposed by Washington Sanchez \cite{loc}. Joining the network
     will be done by explicitly entrusting a certain amount of money to another user. If the second user has already
     entrusted an amount of money to a store, then we trust indirectly the store, thus we can engage in economic interaction
     with said store.

     We thus propose a new kind of wallet where coins are not stored locally, but are placed in 1-of-2 multisigs, a bitcoin
     construction that permits any one of two pre-designated users to spend the coins contained therein \cite{multisig}. We
     will use the notation 1/$\{A, B\}$ to represent a 1-of-2 multisig that can be spent by either of players $A, B$.

     Our approach drastically changes the user experience. A user no more has to worry about stars and ratings to develop
     trust towards a store, she can simply check the trust \textit{flowing} from her to the store (which will be a number
     expressed in bitcoins) and if this number exceeds the price of the product, she is safe to complete the transaction
     after modifying her direct trust towards her friends in an appropriate way, a process that can be handled by one of
     several algorithms that we propose, or in any custom way the user chooses to. On the other side, there is no guarantee
     that the store will complete is part of the transaction and no central authority can reimburse the money. However, it is
     possible for the defrauded user to make up for her loss by in turn stealing from other users that trust her, an action
     that will tautologically reduce their trust to her. The fact that this system can function in a completely distributed
     fashion will become clear in the following sections, along with the positive result that it is in principle Sybil
     resilient.

     There are several incentives for a user to join this network. First of all, they can have access to a store that is
     otherwise unaccessible. Moreover, two friends can formalize their mutual trust by entrusting the same amount to each
     other. A large company that casually subcontracts other companies to complete various tasks can express its trust
     towards them using this method. A government can choose to entrust its citizens with money and confront them using its
     legal arsenal if they make irresponsible use of this trust. A bank can provide loans as outgoing and manage savings as
     incoming trust and thus has a unique opportunity of expressing in a formal and absolute way its credence by publishing
     its incoming trust. Last but not least, the network can be viewed as a possible field for investment and speculation
     since it constitutes a completely new area for financial activity.

     We should note that the current description of TrustIsRisk refers to a static setting where the game evolves in turns.
     In each turn only one user changes the state of the network. Also the system we describe needs full network knowledge
     for all of the users, a situation that may be undesirable because of the privacy-invading implications it brings.
     Future work is needed to address both limitations.

     
  \section{A detailed example}
     The state of the game at any given moment can be represented by a directed weighted graph where each node represents a
     pseudonymous identity that is considered to correspond to exactly one user and each edge represents a direct trust, the
     weight of which is the value which the head entrusts the tail with. [Image] \\
     Each node has a corresponding non-negative number that represents its capital. A node's capital is the total value that
     the node directly and exclusively controls. More technically, it is the number of bitcoins contained in P2PKH
     transactions in the UTXO of which the private keys are controlled by the node. A rational player would like to maximize
     her capital in the long term. Let's suppose that player $A$ wants to buy a product that costs $10$ from player $B$, but
     $A$ has not given any direct trust to $B$. Does $A$'s friends trust $B$ enough so that $A$ can buy the product? In other
     words, should $B$ decide to steal all its incoming direct trust and stop trusting directly other users and the rest of
     the players choose the conservative strategy of stealing from their respective incoming trusts just enough to replenish
     their loss [rationale needed], what would the eventual loss of $A$ be? If it can be higher than the value of the
     product, then $A$ is already exposed to a higher risk to $B$, thus paying for the product can be done without $A$ being
     exposed to any additional risk towards $B$, as long as $A$ reduces the direct trust to her friends enough to reduce the
     risk by the value of the product. If the transaction completes in a satisfying manner, $A$ can replenish the reduced
     trust to her friends, or can even choose to start directly trusting $B$. \\
     Suppose that at the moment $A$ is considering of performing a payment to him, $B$ really decides to depart from the
     network, taking with him all the coins he can. A chain reaction starts throughout the network because each player that
     $B$ exploited is expected to steal enough value from other users that directly trust her to replenish all the value she
     lost to $B$, the newly exploited users will act in the same way and so on, until a new equilibrium is reached
     (\ref{convergence}). Going into detail, [Image] \\

  \section{Definitions}
     \begin{definition}[Graph] \ \\
        TrustIsRisk is represented by a sequence of weighted directed graphs $\left(\mathcal{G}_j\right)$ where $\mathcal{G}_j =
        \left(\mathcal{V}_j, \mathcal{E}_j\right), j \in \mathbb{N}$. Members of $\mathcal{E}_j$ are tuples of two nodes from
        $\mathcal{V}_j$. More formally, $e \in \mathcal{E}_j \Rightarrow \exists A,B \in \mathcal{V}_j : e = \left(A,B\right)$.
        Also, since the graphs are weighted, there exists a sequence of functions $\left(c_j\right)$ with $c_j : \mathcal{E}_j
        \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^{+}$.
     \end{definition}
     \begin{definition}[Players] \ \\
        The set $\mathcal{V}_j = V\left(\mathcal{G}_j\right)$ is the set of all players in the network, otherwise understood
        as the set of all pseudonymous identities.
     \end{definition}
     \begin{definition}[Capital of $A$, $Cap_A$] \ \\
       Total amount of value that exists in P2PKH in the UTXO and can be spent by $A$. We also define $Cap_{A,j}$ as
       the total amount of value that exists in P2PKH in the UTXO and can be spent by $A$ during turn $j$.
     \end{definition}
     \begin{definition}[Direct Trust from $A$ to $B$ After Turn $j$, $DTr_{A \rightarrow B, j}$] \ \\
        Total amount of value that exists in 1/$\{A,B\}$ multisigs in the UTXO in the end of turn $j$, where the money is
        deposited by $A$.
        \begin{equation}
           DTr_{A \rightarrow B, j} =
              \begin{cases}
                 c_j\left(A, B\right), & if \left(A, B\right) \in \mathcal{E}_j \\
                 0, & if \left(A, B\right) \notin \mathcal{E}_j
              \end{cases}
        \end{equation}
        A function or algorithm that has access to the graph $\mathcal{G}_j$ has implicitly access to all direct trusts
        of this graph. The exception are the oracles, which in this case have access only to their incoming and outgoing
        direct trusts.
     \end{definition}
     \begin{definition}[(In/Out) Neighbourhood of $A$ in Turn $j$] \
%, $N^{+}\left(A\right)_j, N^{-}\left(A\right)_j, N\left(A\right)_j$] \ 
        \begin{enumerate}
           \item Let $N^{+}\left(A\right)_j$ be the set of players $B$ that $A$ directly trusts with any positive value at
              the end of turn $j$. More formally,
              \begin{equation}
                 N^{+}\left(A\right)_j = \{B \in \mathcal{V}_j : DTr_{A \rightarrow B, j} > 0\} \enspace.
              \end{equation}
              $N^{+}\left(A\right)_j$ is called out neighbourhood of $A$ on turn $j$. Let $S \subset \mathcal{V}_j$.
              \begin{equation}
                 N^{+}\left(S\right)_j = \bigcup\limits_{A \in S}N^{+}\left(A\right)_j
              \end{equation}
           \item Let $N^{-}\left(A\right)_j$ be the set of players $B$ that directly trust $A$ with any positive value at the
              end of turn $j$. More formally,
              \begin{equation}
                 N^{-}\left(A\right)_j = \{B \in \mathcal{V}_j : DTr_{B \rightarrow A, j} > 0\} \enspace.
              \end{equation}
              $N^{-}\left(A\right)_j$ is called in neighbourhood of $A$ on turn $j$. Let $S \subset \mathcal{V}_j$.
              \begin{equation}
                 N^{-}\left(S\right)_j = \bigcup\limits_{A \in S}N^{-}\left(A\right)_j
              \end{equation}
           \item Let $N\left(A\right)_j$ be the set of players $B$ that either directly trust or are directly trusted by $A$
              with any positive value at the end of turn $j$. More formally,
              \begin{equation}
                 N\left(A\right)_j = N^{+}\left(A\right)_j \cup N^{-}\left(A\right)_j \enspace.
              \end{equation}
              $N\left(A\right)_j$ is called neighbourhood of $A$ on turn $j$. Let $S \subset \mathcal{V}_j$.
              \begin{equation}
                 N\left(S\right)_j = N^{+}\left(S\right)_j \cup N^{-}\left(S\right)_j
              \end{equation}
           \item Let $S \subset \mathcal{V}_j$. Let $N\left(A\right)_{j,i}$ (respectively $N^{+}\left(A\right)_{j,i},
              N^{-}\left(A\right)_{j,i}, N\left(S\right)_{j,i},$ $N^{+}\left(S\right)_{j,i}, N^{-}\left(S\right)_{j,i}$) be
              the $i$-th element of set $N\left(A\right)_j$ (respectively of $N^{+}\left(A\right)_j,  N^{-}\left(A\right)_j,
              N\left(S\right)_j, N^{+}\left(S\right)_j, N^{-}\left(S\right)_j$), according to an arbitrary but fixed
              enumeration of the set players.
        \end{enumerate}
     \end{definition}
     \begin{definition}[Total Incoming/Outgoing Trust of $A$ in Turn $j$]
        \begin{equation}
           in_{A, j} = \sum\limits_{v \in N^{-}\left(A\right)_j}DTr_{v \rightarrow A, j}
        \end{equation}
        \begin{equation}
           out_{A, j} = \sum\limits_{v \in N^{+}\left(A\right)_j}DTr_{A \rightarrow v, j}
        \end{equation}
     \end{definition}
     \begin{definition}[Assets of $A$ in turn $j$, $As_{A, j}$] \ \\
        Sum of $A$'s capital and outgoing trust.
        \begin{equation}
           As_{A, j} = Cap_{A, j} + out_{A, j}
        \end{equation}
        If the turn we refer to is obvious, it is possible to omit $j$.
     \end{definition}
     \begin{definition}[Turns] \ \\
        The game we are describing is turn-based. In each turn $j$ exactly one player $A \in \mathcal{V}, A =
        Player\left(j\right)$, chooses an action (according to a certain strategy) that can be one of the following, or a
        finite combination thereof:
        \begin{enumerate}
           \item Steal value $y_B, 0 \leq y_B \leq DTr_{B \rightarrow A, j-1}$ from $B \in N^{-}\left(A\right)$.
           \begin{equation}
              DTr_{B \rightarrow A, j} = DTr_{B \rightarrow A, j-1} - y_B \:\: \left(Steal\left(y_B, B\right)\right)
           \end{equation}
           \item Add value $y_B, -DTr_{A \rightarrow B, j-1} \leq y_B$ to $B \in \mathcal{V}$.
           \begin{equation}
              DTr_{A \rightarrow B, j} = DTr_{A \rightarrow B, j-1} + y_B \:\: \left(Add\left(y_B, B\right)\right)
           \end{equation}
           When $y_B < 0$, we say that $A$ reduces her trust to $B$ by $-y_B$, when $y_B > 0$, we say that $A$ increases her
           trust to $B$ by $y_B$. If $DTr_{A \rightarrow B, j-1} = 0$, then we say that $A$ starts directly trusting $B$.
        \end{enumerate}
        If player $A$ chooses no action in her turn, we say that she passes her turn. Also, let $Y_{st}, Y_{add}$ be the
        total value to be stolen and added respectively by $A$ in her turn, $j$. For a turn to be feasible, it must hold
        that
        \begin{equation}
           Y_{add} - Y_{st} \leq Cap_{A, j-1} \enspace.
        \end{equation}
        It holds that
        \begin{equation}
           Cap_{A, j} = Cap_{A, j-1} + Y_{st} - Y_{add} \enspace.
        \end{equation}
        Moreover, player $A$ is not allowed to choose two actions of the same kind against the same player in the same turn.
        \\ The set of actions a player makes in turn $j$ is represented with $Turn_j$.
     \end{definition}
     Let $A = Player(j)$. $Turn_j$ Examples:
     \begin{enumerate}
        \item \begin{equation}
           Turn_j = \emptyset
        \end{equation}
        \item \begin{equation}
           Turn_j = \{Steal\left(y, B\right), Add\left(w, B\right)\} \enspace,
        \end{equation}
        given that
        \begin{equation}
           DTr_{B \rightarrow A, j_2 - 1} \leq y \wedge -DTr_{A \rightarrow B, j_2 - 1} \leq w \wedge y - w \leq
           Cap_{A, j_2-1} \enspace.
        \end{equation}
        \item \begin{equation}
           Turn_j = \{Steal\left(x, B\right), Add\left(y, C\right), Add\left(w, D\right)\} \enspace,
        \end{equation}
        given that
        \begin{equation}
        \begin{gathered}
           DTr_{B \rightarrow A, j_3 - 1} \leq x \wedge -DTr_{A \rightarrow C, j_3-1} \leq y \wedge \\
           \wedge -DTr_{A \rightarrow D, j_3 - 1} \leq w \wedge x - y - w \leq Cap_{A, j_3-1} \enspace.
        \end{gathered}
        \end{equation}
        \item \begin{equation}
           Turn_j = \{Steal\left(x, B\right), Steal\left(y, B\right)\}
        \end{equation}
        is not a valid turn because it contains two $Steal\left(\right)$ actions against the same player. If
        \begin{equation}
           x + y \leq DTr_{B \rightarrow A} \enspace,
        \end{equation}
        the correct alternative would be
        \begin{equation}
           Turn_j = \{Steal\left(x+y, B\right)\} \enspace.
        \end{equation}
     \end{enumerate}
     \begin{definition}[Previous/Next Turn of a Player] \ \\
        Let $j \in \mathbb{N}$ a turn with $Player\left(j\right) = A$. We define $prev\left(j\right), next\left(j\right)$ as
        the previous and next turn that $A$ is chosen to play respectively. If $j$ is the first turn that $A$ plays,
        $prev\left(j\right) = 0$. More formally, if
        \begin{equation}
           P = \{k \in \mathbb{N} : k < j \wedge Player\left(k\right) = A\} \mbox{ and}
        \end{equation}
        \begin{equation}
           N = \{k \in \mathbb{N} : k > j \wedge Player\left(k\right) = A\} \enspace,
        \end{equation}
        then we define $prev\left(j\right), next\left(j\right)$ as follows:
        \begin{equation}
           prev\left(j\right) = \begin{cases}
              \max{P}, & P \neq \emptyset \\
              0, & P = \emptyset
           \end{cases}
        \end{equation}
        \begin{equation}
           next\left(j\right) = \min{N}
        \end{equation}
        $next\left(j\right)$ is always well defined with the assumption that eventually everybody plays.
     \end{definition}
     \begin{definition}[$A$ is Stolen $x$] \ \\
        Let $j, j'$ be two consecutive turns of $A$ ($next\left(j\right) = j'$). We say that $A$ has been stolen a value $x$
        between $j$ and $j'$ if
        \begin{equation}
           out_{A,j} - out_{A,j'} > 0 \enspace.
        \end{equation}
        If turns are not specified, we implicitly refer to the current and the previous turns.
     \end{definition}
     \begin{definition}[History] \ \\
        We define History, $\mathcal{H} = \left(\mathcal{H}_j\right)$, as the sequence of all the tuples containing the sets
        of actions and the corresponding player.
        \begin{equation}
           \mathcal{H}_j = \left(Player\left(j\right), Turn_j\right)
        \end{equation}
     \end{definition}
     \begin{definition}[Conservative Strategy] \ \\
        A player $A$ is said to follow the conservative strategy in turn $j$ if for any value $x$ that has been stolen from
        her since the previous turn she played, she substitutes it in her turn by stealing from others that trust her value
        equal to $\min{(x,in_{A,j})}$ and she takes no other action.
        More formally, let $j' = prev\left(j\right), Damage_j = out_{A,j'} - out_{A,j-1}$ and $N^{-}\left(A\right)_j = \{v_1,
        \dots, v_k\}$. It holds that

     As we can see, the definition covers a multitude of options for the conservative player, since in case $0 < Damage_j <

     \begin{equation}
        \forall i, y_i \leq DTr_{N^{-}\left(A\right)_{j,i} \rightarrow A, j-1}

    We observe that the set of players is not modified throughout the Transitive Game, thus we can refer to $\mathcal{V}_j$
    for any turn $j$ as $\mathcal{V}$ in any setting where we use the Transitive Game. \\
    Let $j_0$ be the first turn on which $E$ is chosen to play. Until then, according to theorem \ref{conservativeworld},
    all players will pass their turn. Moreover, let $j' = prev\left(j\right)$ and $\{v_1, \dots, v_k\} =
    N^{-}\left(A\right)_j$. Given that
    \begin{equation}
       Damage_{v,j} = out_{v,j'} - out_{v,j} \enspace,
    \end{equation}
    the algorithm generates turns:
    \begin{equation}
       Turn_j =
         \begin{cases}
            \emptyset, & Damage_{v,j-1} = 0 \\
            \bigcup\limits_{i=1}^{k}\{Steal\left(y_i,v_i\right)\}, & Damage_j > 0
         \end{cases} \enspace.
    \end{equation}
    In the second case, it is
    \begin{equation}
       \sum\limits_{i=1}^{k}y_i = \min\left(in_{v, j-1}, Damage_{v, j-1}\right) \enspace.
    \end{equation}
    From the definition of $Damage_{v,j}$ and knowing that no strategy in this case can increase any direct trust, it is
    obvious that $Damage_{v,j} \geq 0$. Also, we can see that $Loss_{v,j} \geq 0$ because if $Loss_{v,j} < 0$, then $v$ has
    stolen more value than she has been stolen, thus she would not be following the conservative strategy.

    \begin{theorem}[Trust Convergence Theorem] \ \\
       \label{convergence}
       Consider a Transitive Game and let $j_0$ be the first turn that $E$ is chosen to play. Given that all players
       eventually play, there exists a turn $j' > j_0$ such that
       \begin{equation}
          \forall j \geq j', Turn_j = \emptyset \enspace.
       \end{equation}
    \end{theorem}
    \begin{proofsketch}
       If the game didn't converge, the $Steal\left(\right)$ actions would continue forever without reduction of the amount
       stolen over time, thus they would reach infinity. However this is impossible, since there exists only finite total
       trust. For the complete proof, kindly refer to the Appendix (\ref{convergenceproof}).
    \end{proofsketch}
    In games where there exists one evil $E$, one idle player $A$ and the rest of the players are conservative, we define
    $Loss_A = Loss_{A, j}$, where $j$ is a turn that the game has converged. It is important to note that $Loss_A$ is not
    the same for repeated executions of this kind of game, since the order in which players are chosen may differ between
    executions and the conservative players are free to choose which incoming trusts will steal and how much from each.

    Let $G$ be a weighted directed graph. According to \cite{clrs} p. 709, if we consider each edge's capacity as its weight
    ($\forall e \in E(G), c_e = c(e)$), we say that a flow assignment $X = [x_{vw}]_{V(FG) \times V(FG)}$ with a source $A$
    and a sink $B$ is valid when:
    \begin{equation}
    \label{flow1}
       \forall (v, w) \in E(FG), x_{vw} \leq c_{vw}
    \end{equation}
    and

       \forall v \in V(FG) \setminus \{A,B\}, \sum\limits_{w \in N^{+}(v)}x_{wv} = \sum\limits_{w \in N^{-}(v)}x_{vw}

    \begin{theorem}[Trust flow theorem] \ \\
       \label{trustflow}
       Let $\mathcal{G}$ be a game graph and $A, B \in \mathcal{V}$. It holds that

       \end{equation}
       Since $Tr_{A \rightarrow B}$ is the maximum loss that $A$ can suffer after the convergence of the Transitive Game, we

       \begin{equation}
          Tr_{A \rightarrow B} \geq maxFlow\left(A, B\right) \enspace.

       From lemma \ref{gameflow}, this execution corresponds to a flow. Thus
       \begin{equation}
          Tr_{A \rightarrow B} \leq maxFlow\left(A, B\right) \enspace.
       \end{equation}
       We conclude that

    \end{proof}
%       Without loss of generality, we can suppose that the turn in which we are interested is 0 ($\mathcal{G} =
%       \mathcal{G}_0$). First we will show that the $MaxFlow$ can be a result of a valid execution of algorithm
%       \ref{transitivegame} and afterwards we will show that each valid execution of algorithm \ref{transitivegame}
%       corresponds to a valid flow from $A$ to $B$. Thus we will have proven that $Tr_{A \rightarrow B} = maxFlow(A, B)$.
%       \begin{itemize}
%          \item We will first show that there exists an execution of algorithm \ref{transitivegame} such that $Loss_A =
%          maxFlow(A, B)$. Let $X$ be the flows as returned by an execution of the $MaxFlow(A, B)$ algorithm on $\mathcal{G}$.
%          It is known that all flows are DAGs [citation needed] and that all DAGs are a partial order of their nodes based on
%          the partial ordering $x_{vw} \leq 0 \Rightarrow v < w$ [citation needed]. From this partial order, we can create a
%          total order with an algorithm such as topoSort \cite{toposort}. The maximum element of the total order is a node
%          that does not have any outgoing flow. Removing any node from a DAG cannot create a cycle, thus the graph that
%          remains after removing a node from a DAG is also a DAG, thus it has a total order as well, which can be chosen to
%          be the same total order as before removing the node, except for the removed node. If the removed node was maximum
%          or minimum, the new total order is obvious. We will prove our claim using induction. \\
%          \begin{itemize}
%             \item Player $B$ is the maximum node in turn 0 because she is the sink of the MaxFlow algorithm, thus she is the
%             first to be chosen to play and steals all her incoming and outgoing trust. $\forall v \in N^{-}(B)_0, x_{vB}
%             \leq DTr_{v \rightarrow B, 0}$ and $\sum\limits_{v \in N^{-}(B)_0}x_{vB} = maxFlow(A, B)$. The graph
%             $\mathcal{G}_1 = \mathcal{G}_0 \setminus \{B\}$ is also a DAG and corresponds to the previous total order if we
%             remove the maximum element, $B$.
%             \item Suppose that $\forall j \in [k], k > 0$, the player $v$ corresponding to the maximum element is chosen to
%             play for the first time, that $\forall w \in N^{-}(v)_{j-1} (= N^{-}(v)_0), x_{wv} \leq y$ where $Steal(y,w) \in
%             Turn_j \wedge \sum\limits_{w \in N^{-}(v)_0}x_{wv} = \sum\limits_{w \in N^{+}(v)_0}x_{vw}$.
%             \item For $j = k+1$, $Player(k+1) = v'$ corresponds to the maximum element of the previous total order with the
%             element $v$ removed and it is the first time player $v'$ plays, since $v > v'$ in all previous steps thus $v'$
%             was not maximum. It also holds that $\forall w \in N^{-}(v')_0, x_{wv'} \leq DTr_{w \rightarrow v', 0}$ since
%             the $x_{wv'}$ are chosen by the maxFlow algorithm with corresponding capacities the direct trusts and, since
%             $\sum\limits_{w \in N^{-}(v')_0}x_{wv'} = \sum\limits_{w \in N^{+}(v')_0}x_{v'w}$ and player $v'$ has already
%             been stolen value equal to $\sum\limits_{w \in N^{+}(v')_0}x_{v'w}$ (since she has no outgoing flow in turn
%             $j$), player $v'$ can choose to steal from each player $w \in N^{-}(v')_0$ value at least equal to $x_{wv'}$
%             without violating the conservative strategy.
%          \end{itemize}
%          We have proven using induction that if the algorithm chooses only maximum nodes, after exactly $|V(\mathcal{G}_0)|-
%          1$ turns (we do not count idle player $A$) every player except for $A$ will have stolen at least value equal to the
%          flow passing through them and player $A$ will have been stolen value exactly equal to $maxFlow(A, B) \Rightarrow
%          Loss_A = maxFlow(A, B)$.
%          \item We will now show that for any valid execution of algorithm \ref{transitivegame} there exists at least one
%          valid flow from $A$ to $B$, such that $Loss_A = \sum\limits_{v \in N^{+}(A)_0}x_{Av}$. Let $j$ be a turn where
%          \ref{transitivegame} has converged ($j$ exists, according to theorem \ref{convergence}). Then $Loss_{A, j} =
%          out_{A, 0} - out_{A, j}$. We create a new graph $\mathcal{G}'$ such that $V(\mathcal{G}') = V(\mathcal{G}) \cup
%          \{T\}, E(\mathcal{G}') = E(\mathcal{G}) \cup \{(T, v) : v \in Sad_j\} \cup (T, A), \forall (v, w) \in E(\mathcal{G}),
%          c'_{vw} = DTr_{v \rightarrow w, 0} - DTr_{v \rightarrow w, j}, \forall v \in Sad_j, c'_{Tv} = c'_{TA} = \infty$
%          ($T$ is an auxiliary source that trusts infinitely $A$ and all the $Sad$ nodes). We execute the $MaxFlow(T, B)$
%          algorithm on $\mathcal{G}'$ and we get a flow $X' : \forall v,w \in V(\mathcal{G}), x'_{vw} = c'_{vw}$ (all the
%          edges, except for the auxiliary ones, saturated). Thus $\sum\limits_{v \in N^{+}(A)_0}x'_{Av} = Loss_{A, j}$.
%          If we create a new graph $\mathcal{G}''$ with $V(\mathcal{G}'') = V(\mathcal{G}'), E(\mathcal{G}'') =
%          E(\mathcal{G}'), \forall v \in Sad_j, c''_{Tv} = 0, c''_{TA} = \infty, \forall v,w \in V(\mathcal{G}), c''_{vw} =
%          c_{vw}$ (the auxiliary node trusts only $A$) and execute the $MaxFlow(T, B) = X''$ algorithm on $\mathcal{G}''$,
%          $\sum\limits_{v \in N^{+}(A)_0}x''_{Av} = \sum\limits_{v \in N^{+}(A)_0}x'_{Av}$ (the outgoing flow from
%          $A$ will remain the same as in $\mathcal{G}'$) since no capacity accesible from $A$ has been modified (the only
%          changed capacities are those that begin from $T$ and there is no incoming flow to $T$) thus $\sum\limits_{v \in
%          N^{+}(A)_0}x''_{Av} \geq \sum\limits_{v \in N^{+}(A)_0}x'_{Av}$ and $\sum\limits_{v \in N^{+}(A)_0}x'_{Av} =
%          \sum\limits_{v \in N^{+}(A)_0}c'_{Av} = \sum\limits_{v \in N^{+}(A)_0}c''_{Av}$ (the outgoing edges from $A$ were
%          already saturated) thus $\sum\limits_{v \in N^{+}(A)_0}x''_{Av} \leq \sum\limits_{v \in N^{+}(A)_0}x'_{Av}$. Thus
%          the resulting flow is equal to $Loss_{A, j}$, or $\sum\limits_{v \in N^{+}(A)_0}x''_{Av} = \sum\limits_{v \in
%          N^{+}(A)_0}c'_{Av} = Loss_{A, j}$.
%       \end{itemize}
%       We finally conclude that $Tr_{A \rightarrow B} = MaxFlow(A, B)$.
%          \begin{itemize}
%             \item The flow $X$ is obviously valid for the initial graph because $\forall (v,w) \in E(FG), c(v,w) = DTr_{v
%             \rightarrow w, 0} \geq DTr_{v \rightarrow w, 0} - DTr_{v \rightarrow w, j} = c'(v,w) \geq x_{vw}$ and it
%             already holds that $\forall v \in V(FG'), \sum\limits_{w \in N^{-}(v)}x'_{wv} = \sum\limits_{w \in N^{+}(v)}
%             x'_{vw}$, thus it also holds for the flows of $X$.
%             \item We can easily see that $Loss_{A,j} \geq \sum\limits_{v \in N{+}(A)}x_{Av}$ because $Loss_{A,j} =
%             out_{A,0} - out_{A,j} = \sum\limits_{v \in N^{+}(A)}c'(A,v)$. To show that $Loss_{A,j} \leq
%             \sum\limits_{v \in N{+}(A)}x_{Av}$, we first suppose that $Loss_{A,j} > \sum\limits_{v \in N{+}(A)}x_{Av}$. We
%             will now prove that there exists a residual path from $A$ to $B$. $Loss_{A,j} = \sum\limits_{v \in N^{+}(A)}
%             (DTr_{A \rightarrow v, 0} - DTr_{A \rightarrow v, j}) = \sum\limits_{v \in N^{+}(A)}c_{Av}$. From the
%             supposition we can see that $\sum\limits_{v \in N^{+}(A)}c_{Av} > \sum\limits_{v \in N^{+}(A)}x_{Av}
%             \Rightarrow \exists v \in N^{+}(A) : c_{Av} > x_{Av}$. \\
%             Since $\forall v \in V(FG) \setminus \{A,B\}, \sum\limits_{w \in N^{-}(v)}c_{wv} \overset{conservative}{=}
%             \sum\limits_{w \in N^{+}(v)}c_{vw} \wedge \sum\limits_{w \in N^{-}(v)}x_{wv} \overset{flow}{=}
%             \sum\limits_{w \in N^{+}(v)}x_{vw}$, it holds that $\forall v \in V(FG) \setminus \{A,B\}, \sum\limits_{w \in
%             N^{-}(v)}(c_{wv} - x_{wv}) = \sum\limits_{w \in N^{+}(v)}(c_{vw} - x_{vw})$. \\
%             We will now show that $\forall v \in V(FG) \setminus
%             \{A,B\}, (\exists w \in V(FG) : c_{wv} > x_{wv} \Rightarrow \exists u \in V(FG) : c_{vu} > x_{vu})$. Suppose
%             that the previous statement is false. Then it would hold that $\exists v \in V(FG) \setminus \{A,B\} :
%             (\exists w \in V(FG) : c_{wv} > x_{wv} \wedge \forall u \in V(FG), c_{vu} = x_{vu})$ (1). But then we have
%             $\sum\limits_{w \in V(FG)}c_{wv} \overset{(1)}{>} \sum\limits_{w \in V(FG)}x_{wv} \overset{flow}{=}
%             \sum\limits_{w \in V(FG)}x_{vw} \overset{(1)}{=} \sum\limits_{w \in V(FG)}c_{vw} \overset{conservative}{=}
%             \sum\limits_{w \in V(FG)}c_{wv} \Rightarrow \sum\limits_{w \in V(FG)}c_{wv} > \sum\limits_{w \in V(FG)}c_{wv}$
%             which is a contradiction. Thus we showed that $\forall v \in V(FG) \setminus \{A,B\}, (\exists w \in V(FG) :
%             c_{wv} > x_{wv} \Rightarrow \exists u \in V(FG) : c_{vu} > x_{vu})$. \\
%             The flow graph that resulted from
%             $MaxFlow(A, B)$ is a DAG, thus there exists a corresponding total ordering, as we saw before.
%             Obviously $A = v_0$ and $B = v_{|V(FG)|}$. When an element $v_k$ is in the $k$-th position in this total
%             ordering, it has incoming flow only from smaller elements and outgoing flow only to bigger elements, that is
%             $\forall l < k, x_{kl} = 0 \wedge \forall m > k, x_{mk} = 0$.
%             Thus the previous result can be rewritten this way: $\forall k \in [|V(FG)|],
%             (\exists l < k : c_{v_lv_k} > x_{v_lv_k} \Rightarrow \exists m > k : c_{v_kv_m} > x_{v_kv_m})$.
%             Thus, the supposition $Loss_{A, j} > \sum\limits_{v \in N^{+}(A)}x_{Av}$ combined with the previous result shows
%             that there exists a residual path from $A$ to $B$ since we can start from $A$ and find a series of sequential
%             edges that all have flows smaller than the corresponding capacities and eventually reach $B$ in at most
%             $|E(FG)|$ steps, thus $X'$ is not a maximum flow, which is a contradiction. Thus $Loss_{A,j} \leq
%             \sum\limits_{v \in N{+}(A)}x_{Av}$ and, since also $Loss_{A,j} \geq \sum\limits_{v \in N{+}(A)}x_{Av}$, we
%             deduce that $Loss_{A,j} = \sum\limits_{v \in N{+}(A)}x_{Av}$.
%          \end{itemize}
%2nd bullet
%          \item We will now show that for any valid execution of algorithm \ref{transitivegame} there exists at least one
%          valid flow from $A$ to $B$, $X$, such that $Loss_A = \sum\limits_{v \in N^{+}(A)}x_{Av}$. Let $j$ be a turn where
%          \ref{transitivegame} has converged ($j$ exists, according to theorem \ref{convergence}). Then $Loss_{A, j} =
%          out_{A, 0} - out_{A, j}$. Let $\forall v \in N^{+}(A)_0, x_{Av} = DTr_{A \rightarrow v, 0} - DTr_{A \rightarrow
%          v, j}$. For any conservative player $v \in N^{+}(A)_0$, let $\forall w \in N^{+}(v)_0, x_{vw} \leq DTr_{v
%          \rightarrow w, 0} - DTr_{v \rightarrow w, j}, \sum\limits_{w \in N^{+}(A)_0}x_{vw} = x_{Av}$. This is possible
%          because $v$ is conservative, thus the value she stole from $A$ must have been stolen previously from her. More
%          generally, $\forall v \in \mathcal{V}_0 \setminus \{A,B\}, \forall w \in N^{+}(v)_0, x_{vw} \leq
%          DTr_{v \rightarrow w, 0} - DTr_{v \rightarrow w, j}, \sum\limits_{w \in N^{+}(v)_0}x_{vw} = \sum\limits_{w \in
%          N^{-}(v)_0}x_{wv}$. Since the graph we build is a DAG in every step, which corresponds to a partial order, there
%          always exists a total order that we can get using an algorithm such as topoSort [citation needed]. Thus, by
%          choosing to calculate the outgoing flows only of the minimum element of this total order, it is possible to create
%          a valid flow network from $A$ to $B$ in exactly $|V(FG)| - 1$ iterations of the above steps.
%OLD
%          \item The flow to $A$ is the flow that results from the following process: After the execution of
%          \ref{transitivegame}, for each sad player iteratively replenish the $DTr$ stolen from the sad player by the one
%          that stole from her (if multiple players stole from the sad player, then replenish all the stolen $DTr$). Repeat
%          the process until the evil player replenishes the initially stolen $DTr$. This is always possible because if there
%          is no player who stole from each one who is replenished, then the $Steal()$ she did in the first place would not be
%          according to the conservative strategy. Also this process will end with the evil player replenishing $DTr$ equal
%          to the sum of $DTr$ that was stolen from sad players because the conservative players cannot avoid replenishing,
%          or else they do not follow the conservative strategy. The $DTr$ stolen from $A$ will not be replenished, since
%          the player(s) that have stolen from $A$ will not replenish the stolen value and, inductively, this value will not
%          be replenished. Thus $A$ will have been stolen the exact same value that the modified evil player has stolen,
%          $\forall w,v \in V(FG), DTr_{v \rightarrow w} \geq x_{vw}$ (1st requirement for flows) and there would be no node
%          that gets more flow than it pushes, except for $A$ and $B$ (2nd requirement for flows), thus it is a valid flow.
%          \item Let $X$ be the flows as returned by an execution of the $maxFlow$ algorithm. The evil player can steal
%          the values denoted by $X$ and every other player can steal exactly as much as the $X$ flows denote, since they
%          have the 1st property and thus are stealable in any strategy and also hold the 2nd property, thus they comply with
%          the conservative strategy. More concretely, $\forall v,w \in V(FG), DTr_{v \rightarrow w}' = x_{vw}$. Then the two
%          properties of flows hold:
%          \begin{itemize}
%             \item $\forall v,w \in V(FG),x_{vw} \leq DTr_{v \rightarrow w}$ and thus any set of strategies that include only
%             $Steal()$ actions such that $\sum\limits_{y : Steal(y,w) \in Turn_j, Player(j) = v}y = DTr_{v \rightarrow w} -
%             x_{vw}$ is feasible.
%             \item $\forall v \in V(FG) \setminus \{A,B\}, \sum\limits_{w \in N^{+}(v)}x_{wv} =
%             \sum\limits_{w \in N^{-}(v)}x_{vw}$ thus $\forall v \in V(FG) \setminus \{A,B\}, Strategy(v) = Conservative$.
%          \end{itemize}
%             
%       \end{itemize}
%       Thus the maximum value $A$ can lose if $B$ is evil is $Tr_{A \rightarrow B} = maxFlow(A, B)$.
%\ \\ OLDER
%       \begin{enumerate}
%	   \item We will show that $Tr_{A \rightarrow B} \leq MaxFlow(A, B)$.
%          We know that $MaxFlow(A, B) = MinCut_{A \rightarrow B}$. We will show that, if everybody except
%          A and B follows the conservative strategy,  $Tr_{A \rightarrow B} \leq MinCut_{A \rightarrow B}$. Suppose that in
%          round $i$ all the members of the MinCut, $P$, have stolen the maximum value they can from members that belong
%          in the MaxFlow graph and nobody in the partition in which $A$ belongs has stolen yet any value. Let the total
%          stolen value from the MinCut members be $St$. It is obvious that $St_i \leq MinCut_{A \rightarrow B}$, because
%          otherwise there would exist $u \in P$ that doesn't follow the conservative strategy, since they stole more than they
%          were stolen from. The same argument holds for any round $i' > i$ because in each round an conservative player can
%          steal only up to the value she has been stolen. It is also impossible that the $St$ increase further due to
%          stolen value from members of the partition of $B$ since members of $P$ disconnect the two partitions and have
%          already played their turns, thus $\forall i' > i, St_{i'} \leq St_i$. There exists a round, $k$, when all the
%          conservative players stop stealing, so in the worst case $A$ will have been stolen
%          $Tr_{A \rightarrow B} = St_k \leq MinCut_{A \rightarrow B} = MaxFlow(A, B)$.
%          \item We can see that $Tr_{A \rightarrow B} \geq MaxFlow(A, B)$ because the strategy where each
%          one of the non-idle players steals value equal to the incoming flows from their respective friends is a valid
%          strategy that does not contradict with the conservative strategy, since for every conservative player $w$ it holds that
%          $\sum\limits_{v \in N^{-}(w)}x_{vw} = \sum\limits_{v \in N^{+}(w)}x_{wv}$ and according to the strategy each
%          conservative player will have been stolen value equal to $\sum\limits_{v \in N^{+}(w)}x_{wv}$. More concretely,
%          let $Player(j) = B$ and $Player(j+d) = C :$
%       \end{enumerate}
%       Combining the two results, we see that $Tr_{A \rightarrow B} = MaxFlow(A, B)$.
%        OLD PROOF START
%        \begin{enumerate}
%           \item $Tr_{A \rightarrow B} \geq MaxFlow(A, B)$ because by the definition of $Tr_{A \rightarrow B}$,
%           B leaves taking with him all the incoming trust, so there is no trust flowing towards him after leaving.
%           $Tr_{A \rightarrow B} < MaxFlow(A, B)$ would imply that after B left, there would still remain trust
%           flowing from A to B.
%           \item $Tr_{A \rightarrow B} \leq MaxFlow(A, B)$ \\
%           Suppose that $Tr_{A \rightarrow B} > MaxFlow(A, B)$ (1). Then, using the min cut - max flow theorem we
%           see that there is a set of capacities $U= \{u_1,\dots,u_n\}$ with flows $X = \{x_1,\dots,x_n\}$ such that
%           $\sum\limits_{i=1}^{n}{x_i} = MaxFlow(A, B)$ and, if severed $(\forall i \in [n] \: u_i' = 0)$
%           the flow from A to B would be $0$, or, put differently, there would be no directed trust path from A to B. No
%           strategy followed by B could reduce the value of A, so our supposition (1) cannot be true.

    Note: The maxFlow is the same in the following two cases: When a player chooses the evil strategy and when the same
    player chooses a variation of the evil strategy where she does not nullify her outgoing direct trust.
    \begin{theorem}[Trust to Multiple Players] \ \\
       \label{trustmany}
       Let $S \subset \mathcal{V}$ and $T$ auxiliary player such that
       \begin{equation}
          \forall B \in S, DTr_{B \rightarrow T} = \infty \enspace.
       \end{equation}
       It holds that
       \begin{equation}
          \forall A \in \mathcal{V} \setminus S, Tr_{A \rightarrow S} = maxFlow\left(A, T\right) \enspace.
       \end{equation}
    \end{theorem}       
    \begin{proof}
       If $T$ chooses the evil strategy and all players in $S$ play according to the conservative strategy, they will have to
       steal all their incoming direct trust, thus they will act in a way identical to following the evil strategy as far as
       $MaxFlow$ is concerned, thus, according to the Trust Flow Theorem, it holds that
       \begin{equation}
          \forall A \in \mathcal{V} \setminus S, Tr_{A \rightarrow T} = maxFlow\left(A, T\right) = Tr_{A \rightarrow S}
          \enspace.

    One of the primary aims of this system is to mitigate the danger for sybil attacks whilst maintaining fully decentralized
    autonomy. Let Eve be a possible attacker. Since participation in the network does not require any kind of registration,
    Eve can create any number of players. We will call the set of these players $\mathcal{C}$, or Sybil set. Moreover, Eve
    can invest any amount she chooses, thus she can arbitrarily set the direct trusts of any player $C \in \mathcal{C}$ to
    any player $P \in \mathcal{V}$ and can also steal all incoming direct trust to these players. Additionally, we give Eve a
    set of players $B \in \mathcal{B}$ that she has corrupted (the corrupted set), so she fully controls their direct trusts
    to any player $P \in \mathcal{V}$ and can also steal all incoming direct trust to these players. The players $B \in
    \mathcal{B}$ are considered to be legitimate before the corruption, thus they may be directly trusted by any player $P
    \in \mathcal{V}$. However, players $C \in \mathcal{C}$ can be trusted only by players $D \in \mathcal{B} \cup
    \mathcal{C}$ and not by players $A \in \mathcal{V} \setminus (\mathcal{B} \cup \mathcal{C})$. In short,
    \begin{equation}
      \forall D \in \mathcal{B} \cup \mathcal{C}, P \in \mathcal{V}, \mbox{ Eve controls } DTr_{D \rightarrow P}, \mbox{ can
      steal } DTr_{P \rightarrow D}
    \end{equation}
    and can change $|\mathcal{C}|$. Furthermore, the following restriction true:
    \begin{equation}
       \forall C \in \mathcal{C}, P \in \mathcal{V}, DTr_{P \rightarrow C} = 0 \enspace.
    \end{equation}
    \begin{lemma}[No Evil Edges in the $MinCut$] \ \\
       \label{mincutmany}
       Let $S \subset \mathcal{V}, A \notin S$. When calculating $MaxFlow\left(A, S\right)$, it is impossible to have an edge
       $\left(v, w\right) \in MinCut : v \in S$.
    \end{lemma}
    \begin{theorem}[Sybil Resilience] \ \\
       \label{sybil}
       Let $\mathcal{B} \cup \mathcal{C} \subset \mathcal{V}$ with $\mathcal{B} \cap \mathcal{C} = \emptyset$ be a collusion
       of players who are controlled by an adversary, Eve. Eve also controls the number of players in the Sybil set
       $\mathcal{C}, |\mathcal{C}|$. Players $C \in \mathcal{C}$ are not directly trusted by players outside the collusion,
       contrary to players $B \in \mathcal{B}$, the corrupted set, who may be directly trusted by any player in
       $\mathcal{V}$. It then holds that
       \begin{equation}
          Tr_{A \rightarrow \mathcal{B} \cup \mathcal{C}} = Tr_{A \rightarrow \mathcal{B}} \enspace.
       \end{equation}
    \end{theorem}
    \begin{proofsketch}
       The incoming trust to $\mathcal{B} \cup \mathcal{C}$ cannot be higher than the incoming trust to $\mathcal{B}$ since
       $\mathcal{C}$ has no incoming trust from players outside the collusion. For the complete proof, kindly refer to the
       Appendix (\ref{sybilproof}).
    \end{proofsketch}
    \begin{proof}[Sybil Resilience Theorem (\ref{sybil})]
    \label{sybilproof}
       Suppose two separate games $\mathcal{G}_1, \mathcal{G}_2$ with
       \begin{equation}
          (\mathcal{B} \subset \mathcal{V(G)}_1 \wedge \mathcal{B} \subset \mathcal{V(G)}_2) \wedge
       (\mathcal{C} \subset \mathcal{V}_1 \wedge \mathcal{C} \cap \mathcal{V}_2 = \emptyset) \enspace.
       \end{equation}
       Let $T_1 \in \mathcal{V}_1, T_2 \in \mathcal{V}_2$ be two auxiliary players such that
       \begin{align}
          \forall D \in \mathcal{B} \cup \mathcal{C}&, DTr_{D \rightarrow T_1} = \infty \enspace, \\
          \forall B \in \mathcal{B}&, DTr_{B \rightarrow T_2} = \infty \enspace.
       \end{align}
       Suppose also that there exist $|\mathcal{B} \cup \mathcal{C}|$ consecutive turns for the first game and
       $|\mathcal{B}|$ consecutive turns for the second game during which all the colluding players choose actions according
       to the evil strategy. More formally, suppose that
       \begin{equation}
       \begin{gathered}
          \exists j \in \mathbb{N} : \forall d_1 \in [|\mathcal{B} \cup \mathcal{C}|], Player(j+d) \in \mathcal{B} \cup
          \mathcal{C} \wedge \\
          \wedge \forall d_1, d_2 \in [|\mathcal{B} \cup \mathcal{C}|], d_1 \neq d_2, Player(j + d_1) \neq Player(j + d_2)
          \wedge \\
          \wedge \forall d \in [|\mathcal{B} \cup \mathcal{C}|], Strategy(Player(j+d)) = Evil \wedge \\
          \wedge \forall j' \in [j] Player(j') \notin \mathcal{B} \cup \mathcal{C}
       \end{gathered}
       \end{equation}
       for the first and likewise for the second game. \\
       According to theorem (\ref{trustmany}),
       \begin{equation}
          Tr_{A \rightarrow \mathcal{B} \cup \mathcal{C}} = maxFlow\left(A, T_1\right) \wedge
          Tr_{A \rightarrow \mathcal{B}} = maxFlow\left(A, T_2\right) \enspace.
       \end{equation}
       From lemma (\ref{mincutmany}), we know that
       \begin{equation}
          \forall (v,w) \in MinCut, v \notin \mathcal{B} \cup \mathcal{C}
       \end{equation}
       and thus
       \begin{equation}
       \begin{gathered}
          e \in MinCut_1 \Rightarrow e \in \mathcal{E}_2 \wedge \\
          \wedge e \in MinCut_2 \Rightarrow e \in \mathcal{E}_1 \wedge \\
          \wedge \forall e \in MinCut_1 \cup MinCut_2, c_1(e) = c_2(e) \enspace.
       \end{gathered}
       \end{equation}
       Thus the flow $X_1$ resulting from $maxFlow(A, T_1)$ can be used to construct a valid flow of equal
       value for the second case if we set
       \begin{align}
          \forall v \in \mathcal{V}_2 \setminus \mathcal{B}, \forall w \in \mathcal{V}_2&, x_{vw,2} = x_{vw,1} \enspace, \\
          \forall v \in \mathcal{B}&, x_{vT_2,2} = \sum\limits_{w \in N^{+}(v)}x_{vw,1} \enspace, \\
          \forall v,w \in \mathcal{B} \cup \mathcal{C}&, x_{vw,2} = 0 \enspace.
       \end{align}
       Likewise, the flow $X_2$ resulting from $maxFlow(A, T_2)$ can be
       used to construct a valid flow of equal value for the first case if we set
       \begin{align}
          \forall v \in \mathcal{V}_1 \setminus (\mathcal{B} \cup \mathcal{C}), \forall w \in \mathcal{V}_1&, x_{vw,1} =
          x_{vw,2} \enspace, \\
          \forall v \in \mathcal{B}&, x_{vT_1,1} = \sum\limits_{w \in N^{+}(v)}x_{vw,2} \enspace, \\
          \forall v \in \mathcal{C}, \forall w \in \mathcal{V}_1&, x_{vw,1} = 0 \enspace.
       \end{align}
       From these two observations, we deduce that there exists a function, say $F_2(X_1)$, that transforms
       the $MaxFlow_1$ of the first graph into a valid flow for the second graph that has the same amount of flow as
       $MaxFlow_1$ and there also exists a similar function $F_1(X_2)$ that transforms the $MaxFlow_2$ of the second graph
       into a valid flow for the first graph that has the same amount of flow as $MaxFlow_2$. Suppose that
       \begin{equation}
         maxFlow_1 < maxFlow_2 \enspace.
       \end{equation}
       Then
       \begin{equation}
          F_1(MaxFlow_2) > maxFlow_1 \enspace,
       \end{equation}
       which is a contradiction. Likewise, suppose that
       \begin{equation}
          maxFlow_1 > maxFlow_2 \enspace.
       \end{equation}
       Then
       \begin{equation}
          F_2(MaxFlow_1) > maxFlow_2 \enspace,
       \end{equation}
       which is also a contradiction. We conclude that
       \begin{equation}
          maxFlow(A, T_1) = maxFlow(A, T_2) \enspace,
       \end{equation}
       thus
       \begin{equation}
          Tr_{A \rightarrow \mathcal{B}} = Tr_{A \rightarrow \mathcal{B} \cup \mathcal{C}} \enspace.
       \end{equation}
       \qed
    \end{proof}
%       Consider the partition of
%       $\mathcal{V}, \mathcal{P} = \{\mathcal{B} \cup \mathcal{C}, \mathcal{V} \setminus (\mathcal{B} \cup \mathcal{C})\} =
%       \{P_1, P_2\}$. The edges from $P_2$ to $P_1$ will carry a flow $X_P, X_{P'}$ and the edges inside of $P_1$ will carry
%       a flow $X_T, X_{T'}$ from the calculation of $maxFlow(A, T), maxFlow(A, T')$ respectively. $maxFlow(A, T) \leq
%       maxFlow(A, T')$ because the maximal configuration of $X_T$ can be part of a valid configuration of $X_{T'}$ since
%       edges in $\mathcal{B}$ are edges in $\mathcal{B} \cup \mathcal{C}$. Both maxFlows are not infinite, because $out_A <
%       \infty$ and according to \ref{mincutmany} all the edges in both $MinCut$s have their starting point outside
%       $\mathcal{B} \cup \mathcal{C}$. However, then in both cases the minCut is the same, thus $maxFlow(A, T) =
%       maxFlow(A, T')$. MISSING Thus we conclude that $Tr_{A \rightarrow \mathcal{B}} =
%       Tr_{A \rightarrow \mathcal{B} \cup \mathcal{C}}$.
    We have proven that controlling $|\mathcal{C}|$ is irrelevant for Eve, thus Sybil attacks are meaningless.

  \section{Related Work}

  \section{Further Research}
     While our trust network can form a basis for risk-invariant transactions in the anonymous and decentralized setting,
     more research is required to achieve other desirable properties. Some directions for future research are outlined below.

  \subsection{Zero knowledge}
     Our network evaluates indirect trust by computing the max flow in the graph of lines-of-credit. In order to do that,
     complete information about the network is required. However, disclosing the network topology may be undesirable, as it
     subverts the identity of the participants even when participants are treated pseudonymously, as deanonymisation
     techniques can be used \cite{deanonymisation}. To avoid such issues, exploring the ability to calculate flows in a zero
     knowledge fashion may be desirable. However, performing network queries in zero knowledge may allow an adversary to
     extract topological information. More research is required to establish how flows can be calculated effectively in zero
     knowledge and what bounds exist in regards to information revealed in such fashion.

  \section*{Appendix}
    \begin{lemma}[$Loss$ Equivalent to $Damage$] \ \\
       Let $j \in \mathbb{N}, v \in \mathcal{V}_j \setminus \{A, E\}, v = Player\left(j\right)$. It holds that
       \begin{equation}
          \min\left(in_{v, j}, Loss_{v, j}\right) = \min\left(in_{v, j}, Damage_{v, j}\right) \enspace.
       \end{equation}
    \end{lemma}
    \begin{proof}
       \begin{itemize}
          \item Let $v \in Happy_{j-1}$. Then
          \begin{enumerate}
             \item $v \in Happy_j$ because $Turn_{j} = \emptyset$,
             \item $Loss_{v, j} = 0$ because otherwise $v \notin Happy_j$,
             \item $Damage_{v, j} = 0$, or else any reduction in direct trust to $v$ would increase equally
             $Loss_{v, j}$ (line~\ref{trsteallossincrease}), which cannot be decreased again but during an Angry player's turn
             (line~\ref{trsteallossdecrease}).
             \item $in_{v, j} \geq 0$
          \end{enumerate}
          Thus
          \begin{equation}
             v \in Happy_{j-1} \Rightarrow \min\left(in_{v, j}, Damage_{v,j}\right) = \min\left(in_{v, j}, Loss_{v,j}\right)
             = 0 \enspace.
          \end{equation}
          \item Let $v \in Sad_{j-1}$. Then
          \begin{enumerate}
             \item $v \in Sad_j$ because $Turn_{j} = \emptyset$, 
             \item $in_{v, j} = 0$ (lines~\ref{trstealifentersad} -~\ref{trstealtrueentersad}),
             \item $Damage_{v, j} \geq 0 \wedge Loss_{v, j} \geq 0$.
          \end{enumerate}
          Thus
          \begin{equation}
             v \in Sad_{j-1} \Rightarrow \min\left(in_{v, j}, Damage_{v,j}\right) = \min\left(in_{v, j}, Loss_{v,j}\right) =
             0 \enspace.
          \end{equation}
          \item Let $v \in Angry_{j-1} \wedge v \in Happy_j$. Then the same argument as in the first case holds, if
          we ignore the argument (1).
          \item Let $v \in Angry_{j-1} \wedge v \in Sad_j$. Then the same argument as in the second case holds, if 
          we ignore the argument (1).
       \end{itemize} \qed
    \end{proof}

    \begin{proof}[Trust Convergence Theorem (\ref{convergence})]
    \label{convergenceproof}
       First of all,
       \begin{equation}
          \forall j > j_0 : Player\left(j\right) = E \Rightarrow Turn_j = \emptyset
       \end{equation}
        because $E$ has already nullified his incoming and outgoing direct trusts in $Turn_{j_0}$, the evil strategy does not
       contain any case where direct trust is increased or where the evil player starts directly trusting another player and
       the other players do not follow a strategy in which they can choose to $Add\left(\right)$ trust to $E$, thus player
       $E$ can do nothing $\forall j > j_0$. We also see that
       \begin{equation}
          \forall j > j_0 : Player(j) = A \Rightarrow Turn_j = \emptyset
       \end{equation}
       because of the idle strategy that $A$ follows. As far as the rest of the players are concerned, consider the
       Transitive Game. As we can see from lines~\ref{trsteallossinit} and~\ref{trsteallossincrease}
       -~\ref{trsteallossdecrease}, it is
       \begin{equation}
          \forall j, \sum\limits_{v \in \mathcal{V}_j}Loss_v = in_{E, j_0-1} \enspace.
       \end{equation}
       In other words, the total loss is constant and equal to the total value stolen by $E$. Also, as we can see in
       lines~\ref{trstealsadinit} and~\ref{trstealtrueentersad}, which are the only lines where the $Sad$ set is modified,
       once a player enters the $Sad$ set, it is impossible to exit from this set. Also, we can see that players in $Sad
       \cup Happy$ always pass their turn. We will now show that eventually the $Angry$ set will be empty, or equivalently
       that eventually every player will pass their turn. Suppose that it is possible to have an infinite amount of turns
       in which players do not choose to pass. We know that the number of nodes is finite, thus this is possible only if
       \begin{equation}
          \exists j': \forall j \geq j', |Angry_j \cup Happy_j| = c > 0 \wedge Angry_j \neq \emptyset \enspace.
       \end{equation}
       This statement is valid because the total number of angry and happy players cannot increase because no player leaves
       the $Sad$ set and if it were to be decreased, it would eventually reach 0. Since $Angry_j \neq \emptyset$, a player
       $v$ that will not pass her turn will eventually be chosen to play. According to the Transitive Game, $v$ will either
       deplete her incoming trust and enter the $Sad$ set (line~\ref{trstealtrueentersad}), which is contradicting $|Angry_j
       \cup Happy_j| = c$, or will steal enough value to enter the $Happy$ set, that is $v$ will achieve $Loss_{v, j} = 0$.
       Suppose that she has stolen $m$ players. They, in their turn, will steal total value at least equal to the value
       stolen by $v$ (since they cannot go sad, as explained above). However, this means that, since the total value being
       stolen will never be reduced and the turns this will happen are infinite, the players must steal an infinite amount of
       value, which is impossible because the direct trusts are finite in number and in value. More precisely, let $j_1$ be
       a turn in which a conservative player is chosen and
       \begin{equation}
          \forall j \in \mathbb{N}, DTr_j = \sum\limits_{w,w' \in \mathcal{V}}DTr_{w \rightarrow w', j} \enspace.
       \end{equation}
       Also, without loss of generality, suppose that
       \begin{equation}
          \forall j \geq j_1, out_{A, j} = out_{A, j_1} \enspace.
       \end{equation}
       In $Turn_{j_1}$, $v$ steals
       \begin{equation}
          St = \sum\limits_{i=1}^{m}y_i \enspace.
       \end{equation}
       We will show using induction that
       \begin{equation}
          \forall n \in \mathbb{N}, \exists j_n \in \mathbb{N} : DTr_{j_n} \leq DTr_{j_1-1} - nSt \enspace.
       \end{equation}
       Base case: It holds that
       \begin{equation}
          DTr_{j_1} = DTr_{j_1-1} - St \enspace.
       \end{equation}
       Eventually there is a turn $j_2$ when every player in $N^{-}(v)$ will have played. Then it holds that
       \begin{equation}
          DTr_{j_2} \leq DTr_{j_1} - St = DTr_{j_1-1} - 2St \enspace,
       \end{equation}
       since all players in $N^{-}(v)$ follow the conservative strategy, except for $A$, who will not have been stolen
       anything due to the supposition. \\
       Induction hypothesis: Suppose that
       \begin{equation}
          \exists k > 1 : j_k > j_{k-1} > j_1 \Rightarrow DTr_{j_k} \leq DTr_{j_{k-1}} - St \enspace.
       \end{equation}
       Induction step: There exists a subset of the $Angry$ players, $S$, that have been stolen at least value $St$ in total
       between the turns $j_{k-1}$ and $j_k$, thus there exists a turn $j_{k+1}$ such that all players in $S$ will have
       played and thus
       \begin{equation}
          DTr_{j_{k+1}} \leq DTr_{j_k} - St \enspace.
       \end{equation}
       We have proven by induction that
       \begin{equation}
          \forall n \in \mathbb{N}, \exists j_n \in \mathbb{N} : DTr_{j_n} \leq DTr_{j_1-1} - nSt \enspace.
       \end{equation}
       However
       \begin{equation}
          DTr_{j_1-1} \geq 0 \wedge St > 0 \enspace,
       \end{equation}
       thus
       \begin{equation}
          \exists n' \in \mathbb{N} : n'St > DTr_{j_1-1} \Rightarrow DTr_{j_{n'}} < 0 \enspace.
       \end{equation}
       We have a contradiction because
       \begin{equation}
          \forall w,w' \in \mathcal{V}, \forall j \in \mathbb{N}, DTr_{w \rightarrow w', j} \geq 0 \enspace,
       \end{equation}
       thus eventually $Angry = \emptyset$ and everybody passes. \qed
    \end{proof}

    \begin{proof}[MaxFlows Are Transitive Games Lemma (\ref{maxflowgame})] \ \\
    \label{maxflowgameproof}
       Without loss of generality, we suppose that the interesting turn is 0. In other words, $j_0 = 0$. Let $X =
       \{x_{vw}\}_{\mathcal{V} \times \mathcal{V}}$ be the flows returned by the execution of the $MaxFlow\left(A, B\right)$
       algorithm on $\mathcal{G}_0$. It is known that for any directed weighted graph $G$ there exists a $MaxFlow$ over $G$
       that is a DAG [citation needed]. We also know that we can apply the topological sort algorithm to any DAG and obtain a
       total ordering of its nodes with the following property: $\forall$ nodes $v, w$, it holds that
       $v < w \Rightarrow x_{wv} = 0$ [citation needed]. Put differently, there is no flow from larger to smaller nodes. We
       execute the topological sort on $X$ and obtain a total order of the nodes, such that $B$ is the maximum and
       $A$ is the minimum node. $B$ is maximum since it is the sink and thus has no outgoing flow to any node and $A$ is
       minimum since it is the source and thus has no incoming flow from any node. The desired execution of algorithm
       \ref{transitivegame} will choose players following the total order, starting from player $B$. We observe that
       $\forall v \in \mathcal{V} \setminus \{A, B\}, \sum\limits_{w \in \mathcal{V}}x_{wv} = \sum\limits_{w \in
       \mathcal{V}}x_{vw} \leq maxFlow\left(A, B\right) \leq in_{B, 0}$. Player $B$ will follow a modified evil strategy
       where she steals value equal to her total incoming flow, not her total incoming trust. Let $j_2$ be the first turn
       when $A$ is chosen to play. We will show using strong induction that there exists a set of valid actions for each
       player according to their respective strategy such that at the end of each turn $j$ the corresponding player $v =
       Player\left(j\right)$ will have stolen value $x_{wv}$ from each in neighbour $w$. \\
       Base case: In turn 1, $B$ steals value equal to $\sum\limits_{w \in \mathcal{V}}x_{wB}$, following the modified evil
       strategy.
       \begin{equation}
          Turn_1 = \bigcup\limits_{v \in N^{-}\left(B\right)_0}\{Steal\left(x_{vB}, v\right)\}
       \end{equation}
       Induction hypothesis: Let $k \in [j_2 - 2]$. We suppose that $\forall j \in [k]$, there exists a valid set of actions,
       $Turn_j$, performed by $v = Player\left(j\right)$ such that $v$ steals from each player $w$ value equal to $x_{wv}$.
       \begin{equation}
          \forall j \in [k], Turn_j = \bigcup\limits_{w \in N^{-}\left(v\right)_{j-1}}\{Steal\left(x_{wv}, w\right)\}
       \end{equation}
       Induction step: Let $j = k + 1, v = Player\left(j\right)$. Since all the players that are greater than $v$ in the
       total order have already played and all of them have stolen value equal to their incoming flow, we deduce that $v$ has
       been stolen value equal to $\sum\limits_{w \in N^{+}\left(v\right)_{j-1}}x_{vw}$. Since it is the first time $v$
       plays, $\forall w \in N^{-}\left(v\right), DTr_{w \rightarrow v, j-1} = DTr_{w \rightarrow v, 0} \geq x_{wv}$, thus
       $v$ is able to choose the following turn:
       \begin{equation}
          Turn_j = \bigcup\limits_{w \in N^{-}\left(v\right)_{j-1}}\{Steal\left(x_{wv}, w\right)\}
       \end{equation}
       Moreover, this turn satisfies the conservative strategy since
       \begin{equation}
          \sum\limits_{w \in N^{-}\left(v\right)_{j-1}}x_{wv} = \sum\limits_{w \in N^{+}\left(v\right)_{j-1}}x_{vw} \enspace.
       \end{equation}
       Thus $Turn_j$ is a valid turn for the conservative player $v$. \\
       We have proven that in the end of turn $j_2 - 1$, player $B$ and all the conservative players will have stolen value
       exactly equal to their total incoming flow, thus $A$ will have been stolen value equal to her outgoing flow, which is
       $maxFlow(A, B)$. Since there remains no Angry player, it is obvious that $j_2$ is a turn that Transitive Game has
       converged thus $Loss_{A, j_2} = Loss_A$. It is also obvious that if $B$ had chosen the original evil strategy, the
       described actions would still be valid only by supplementing them with additional $Steal\left(\right)$ actions, thus
       $Loss_A$ would further increase.  We have proven that there exists a valid execution of the Transitive Game where
       \begin{equation}
          Loss_A \geq maxFlow\left(A, B\right) \enspace.
       \end{equation}
       \qed
    \end{proof}

    \begin{proof}[Transitive Games Are Flows Lemma (\ref{gameflow})]
    \label{gameflowproof}
       Let $\mathcal{G}'$ be a directed weighted graph based on $\mathcal{G}$ with an auxiliary source. Let also $j_1$ be a
       turn when the Transitive Game has converged. More precisely, $\mathcal{G}'$ is defined as follows:
       \begin{equation}
          \mathcal{V}' = \mathcal{V} \cup \{T\}
       \end{equation}
       \begin{equation}
          \mathcal{E}' = \mathcal{E} \cup \{(T, A)\} \cup \{(T, v) : v \in Sad_{j_1}\}
       \end{equation}
       \begin{equation}
          \forall (v, w) \in \mathcal{E}, c'_{vw} = DTr_{v \rightarrow w, 0} - DTr_{v \rightarrow w, j_1}
       \end{equation}
       \begin{equation}
          \forall v \in Sad_{j_1}, c'_{Tv} = c'_{TA} = \infty
       \end{equation}
       (Image)
       We observe that $\forall v \in \mathcal{V},$
       \begin{equation}
       \label{gameflowin}
          \sum\limits_{w \in N^{-}\left(v\right) \setminus \{T\}}c'_{wv} = \sum\limits_{w \in
          N^{-}\left(v\right) \setminus \{T\}}\left(DTr_{w \rightarrow v, 0} - DTr_{w \rightarrow v, j_1}\right) = in_{v, 0}
          - in_{v, j_1}
       \end{equation}
       and
       \begin{equation}
       \label{gameflowout}
          \sum\limits_{w \in N^{+}\left(v\right) \setminus \{T\}}c'_{vw} = \sum\limits_{w \in N^{+}\left(v\right) \setminus
          \{T\}}\left(DTr_{v \rightarrow w, 0} - DTr_{v \rightarrow w, j_1}\right) = out_{v, 0} - out_{v, j_1} \enspace.
       \end{equation}
       We can suppose that
       \begin{equation}
       \label{Aincoming}
          \forall j \in \mathbb{N}, in_{A, j} = 0 \enspace,
       \end{equation}
       since if we find a valid flow under this assumption, the flow will still be valid for the original graph. \\
       Next we try to calculate $MaxFlow\left(T, B\right) = X'$ on graph $\mathcal{G}'$. We observe that a flow in which it
       holds that $\forall v, w \in \mathcal{V}, x'_{vw} = c'_{vw}$ can be valid for the following reasons:
       \begin{itemize}
          \item $\forall v,w \in \mathcal{V}, x'_{vw} \leq c'_{vw}$ (Capacity flow requirement (\ref{flow1}) $\forall e \in
          \mathcal{E}$)
          \item Since $\forall v \in Sad_{j_1} \cup \{A\}, c'_{Tv} = \infty$, requirement (\ref{flow1}) holds for any flow
          $x'_{Tv} \geq 0$.
          \item Let $v \in \mathcal{V}' \setminus \left(Sad_{j_1} \cup \{T, A, B\}\right)$. According to the conservative
          strategy and since $v \notin Sad_{j_1},$ it holds that
          \begin{equation}
             out_{v, 0} - out_{v, j_1} = in_{v, 0} - in_{v, j_1} \enspace.
          \end{equation}
          Combining this observation with (\ref{gameflowin}) and (\ref{gameflowout}), we have that
          \begin{equation}
             \sum\limits_{w \in \mathcal{V}'}c'_{vw} = \sum\limits_{w \in \mathcal{V}'}c'_{wv} \enspace.
          \end{equation}
          (Flow Conservation requirement (\ref{flow2}) $\forall v \in \mathcal{V}' \setminus \left(Sad_{j_1}
          \cup \{T, A, B\}\right)$)
          \item Let $v \in Sad_{j_1}$. Since $v$ is sad, we know that
          \begin{equation}
             out_{v, 0} - out_{v, j_1} > in_{v, 0} - in_{v, j_1} \enspace.
          \end{equation}
          Since $c'_{Tv} = \infty$, we can set
          \begin{equation}
             x'_{Tv} = \left(out_{v, 0} - out_{v, j_1}\right) - \left(in_{v, 0} - in_{v, j_1}\right) \enspace.
          \end{equation}
          In this way, we have
          \begin{equation}
             \sum\limits_{w \in \mathcal{V}'}x'_{vw} = out_{v, 0} - out_{v, j_1} \mbox{ and}
          \end{equation}
          \begin{equation}
          \begin{gathered}
             \sum\limits_{w \in \mathcal{V}'}x'_{wv} = \sum\limits_{w \in \mathcal{V}' \setminus \{T\}}c'_{wv} + x'_{Tv} =
             in_{v, 0} - in_{v, j_1} + \\ + (out_{v, 0} - out_{v, j_1}) - (in_{v, 0} - in_{v, j_1}) = out_{v, 0} -
             out_{v, j_1} \enspace.
          \end{gathered}
          \end{equation}
          thus
          \begin{equation}
             \sum\limits_{w \in \mathcal{V}'}x'_{vw} = \sum\limits_{w \in \mathcal{V}'}x'_{wv} \enspace.
          \end{equation}
          (Requirement \ref{flow2} $\forall v \in Sad_{j_1}$)
          \item We set
          \begin{equation}
             x'_{TA} = \sum\limits_{v \in \mathcal{V}'}x'_{Av} \enspace,
          \end{equation}
          thus from (\ref{Aincoming}) we have
          \begin{equation}
             \sum\limits_{v \in \mathcal{V}'}x'_{vA} = \sum\limits_{v \in \mathcal{V}'}x'_{Av} \enspace.
          \end{equation}
          (Requirement \ref{flow2} for $A$)
       \end{itemize}
       We saw that for all nodes, the necessary properties for a flow to be valid hold and thus $X'$ is a valid flow for
       $\mathcal{G}$. Moreover, this flow is equal to $maxFlow(T, B)$ because all incoming flows to $B$ are saturated.
       Also we observe that
       \begin{equation}
       \label{xprimeequalloss}
          \sum\limits_{v \in \mathcal{V}'}x'_{Av} = \sum\limits_{v \in \mathcal{V}'}c'_{Av} = out_{A, 0} - out_{A, j_1} =
          Loss_A \enspace.
       \end{equation}
       We define another graph, $\mathcal{G}''$, based on $\mathcal{G}'$.
       \begin{equation}
          \mathcal{V}'' = \mathcal{V}'
       \end{equation}
       \begin{equation}
          E(\mathcal{G}'') = E(\mathcal{G}') \setminus \{(T, v) : v \in Sad_j\}
       \end{equation}
       \begin{equation}
          \forall e \in E(\mathcal{G}''), c''_e = c'_e
       \end{equation}
       If we execute the algorithm $MaxFlow(T, B)$ on the graph $\mathcal{G}''$, we will obtain a flow $X''$ in which
       \begin{equation}
          \sum\limits_{v \in \mathcal{V}''}x''_{Tv} = x''_{TA} = \sum\limits_{v \in \mathcal{V}''}x''_{Av} \enspace.
       \end{equation}
       The outgoing flow from $A$ in $X''$ will remain the same as in $X'$ for two reasons: \\
       No capacity reachable by $A$ is modified and $T$ has no incoming flow, thus
       \begin{equation}
          \sum\limits_{v \in \mathcal{V}''}x''_{Av} \geq \sum\limits_{v \in \mathcal{V}'}x'_{Av} \mbox{[citation needed] and}
       \end{equation}
       \begin{equation}
          \begin{rcases}
             \sum\limits_{v \in \mathcal{V}''}c''_{Av} = \sum\limits_{v \in \mathcal{V}'}c'_{Av} = \sum\limits_{v \in
             \mathcal{V}'}x'_{Av} \\
             \sum\limits_{v \in \mathcal{V}''}c''_{Av} \geq \sum\limits_{v \in \mathcal{V}''}x''_{Av}
          \end{rcases}
          \Rightarrow \sum\limits_{v \in \mathcal{V}''}x''_{Av} \leq \sum\limits_{v \in \mathcal{V}'}x'_{Av}
       \end{equation}
       Thus we conclude that
       \begin{equation}
       \label{primeequaldoubleprime}
          \sum\limits_{v \in \mathcal{V}''}x''_{Av} = \sum\limits_{v \in \mathcal{V}'}x'_{Av} \enspace.
       \end{equation}
       Let $X = X'' \setminus \{(T, A)\}$. Observe that
       \begin{equation}
          \sum\limits_{v \in \mathcal{V}''}x''_{Av} = \sum\limits_{v \in \mathcal{V}}x_{Av} \enspace.
       \end{equation}
       This flow is valid on graph $\mathcal{G}$ because
       \begin{equation}
          \forall e \in \mathcal{E}, c_e \geq c''_e \enspace.
       \end{equation}
%       We will now prove that
%       \begin{equation}
%          X = MaxFlow_{\mathcal{G}}\left(A, B\right) \enspace.
%       \end{equation}
%       \begin{itemize}
%          \item Let $X^A = MaxFlow_{\mathcal{G}}$. If we suppose that
%          \begin{equation}
%             maxFlow_{\mathcal{G}}\left(A, B\right) > \sum\limits_{v \in \mathcal{V}''}x''_{Av} \enspace,
%          \end{equation}
%          then we can set
%          \begin{equation}
%             X^T = X \cup \{(T, A)\} \mbox{ with}
%          \end{equation}
%          \begin{equation}
%             \forall v, w \in \mathcal{V}'', x^T_{vw} = x^A_{vw} \mbox{ and}
%          \end{equation}
%          \begin{equation}
%             x^T_{TA} = \sum\limits_{v \in \mathcal{V}''}x^A_{Av} \enspace.
%          \end{equation}
%          Since
%          \begin{equation}
%             \sum\limits_{v \in \mathcal{V}''}x^A_{Av} = maxFlow_{\mathcal{G}}\left(A, B\right) \enspace,
%          \end{equation}
%          we see that
%          \begin{equation}
%             \sum\limits_{v \in \mathcal{V}''}x^T_{Tv} = x^T_{TA} > x''_{TA} \enspace,
%          \end{equation}
%          thus $X''$ is not $MaxFlow_{\mathcal{G}}\left(T, B\right)$, which is a contradiction. Thus
%          \begin{equation}
%             maxFlow_{\mathcal{G}}\left(A, B\right) \leq \sum\limits_{v \in \mathcal{V}''}x''_{Av} \enspace,
%          \end{equation}
%          therefore
%          \begin{equation}
%             maxFlow_{\mathcal{G}}\left(A, B\right) \leq \sum\limits_{v \in \mathcal{V}}x_{Av} \enspace.
%          \end{equation}
%          \item If we suppose that
%          \begin{equation}
%             maxFlow_{\mathcal{G}}\left(A, B\right) < \sum\limits_{v \in \mathcal{V}''}x''_{Av} \enspace,
%          \end{equation}
%          we can likewise choose $X^A$ such that
%          \begin{equation}
%             \forall v, w \in \mathcal{V}'' \setminus \{T\}, x^A_{vw} = x''_{vw} \enspace,
%          \end{equation}
%          thus
%          \begin{equation}
%             \sum\limits_{v \in \mathcal{V}'' \setminus \{T\}}x^A_{Av} = \sum\limits_{v \in \mathcal{V}''}x''_{Av} \enspace.
%          \end{equation}
%          We deduce that
%          \begin{equation}
%             \sum\limits_{v \in \mathcal{V}'' \setminus \{T\}}x^A_{Av} > maxFlow_{\mathcal{G}}\left(A, B\right) \enspace,
%          \end{equation}
%          which is a contradiction. Thus
%          \begin{equation}
%             maxFlow_{\mathcal{G}}\left(A, B\right) \geq \sum\limits_{v \in \mathcal{V}''}x''_{Av} \enspace,
%          \end{equation}
%          therefore
%          \begin{equation}
%             maxFlow_{\mathcal{G}}\left(A, B\right) \geq \sum\limits_{v \in \mathcal{V}}x_{Av} \enspace.
%          \end{equation}
%       \end{itemize}
       Thus there exists a valid flow for each execution of the Transitive Game such that
       \begin{equation}
          \sum\limits_{v \in \mathcal{V}}x_{Av} = \sum\limits_{v \in \mathcal{V}''}x''_{Av}
          \overset{\left(\ref{primeequaldoubleprime}\right)}{=} \sum\limits_{v \in \mathcal{V}'}x'_{Av}
          \overset{\left(\ref{xprimeequalloss}\right)}{=} Loss_{A, j_1} \enspace,
       \end{equation}
       which is the flow $X$. \qed

    \begin{theorem}[Conservative World Theorem] \ \\
       \label{conservativeworld}
       If everybody follows the conservative strategy, nobody steals any amount from anybody.
    \end{theorem}
    \begin{proofsketch}
       If everybody is conservative, nobody can initiate the chain of steals.
    \end{proofsketch}
    \begin{proof} \ \\
       Suppose that we are interested in graphs $\mathcal{G}_j$.
       \begin{equation}
       \begin{gathered}
          \mbox{Let } (j_k) \mbox{ an increasing sequence of positive integers,} \\
          \mbox{let } S_{j_k} \subseteq N^{-}\left(Player\left(j_k\right)\right)_{j_k} \mbox{ and} \\
          \mbox{let } \forall v \in S_{j_k}, y_{v, j_k} > 0\enspace.
       \end{gathered}
       \end{equation}
       Suppose that there exists a subseries of History, $(Turn_{j_k})$, where
       \begin{equation}
          Turn_{j_k} = \bigcup\limits_{v \in S_{j_k}}\{Steal(y_{v, j_k},v)\} \enspace,
       \end{equation}
       This subseries must have an initial element, $Turn_{j_1}$. However, $Player(j_1)$ follows the conservative strategy,
       thus somebody must have stolen from her as well, so $Player(j_1)$ cannot be the initial element. We have a
       contradiction, thus there cannot exist a series of stealing actions when everybody is conservative.
       \qed
    \end{proof}

    \begin{proof}[No Evil Edges in the $MinCut$ Lemma (\ref{mincutmany}]
    \label{mincutmanyproof}
       Let $T$ be the auxiliary node. It is
       \begin{equation}
          \forall v \in S, c_{vT} = \infty \enspace.
       \end{equation}
       We can see that $out_A < \infty$ and thus
       \begin{equation}
       \label{maxflowbounded}
          maxFlow\left(A, S\right) < \infty \enspace.
       \end{equation}
       Since all edges in the $MinCut$ are saturated and due to (\ref{maxflowbounded}), we have
       \begin{equation}
          \nexists v \in S : \left(v, T\right) \in MinCut \enspace.
       \end{equation}
       Suppose that
       \begin{equation}
          \exists v \in S, w \in \mathcal{V} : \left(v, w\right) \in MinCut \enspace.
       \end{equation}
       Then this edge must be saturated, that is $x_{vw} = c_{vw} > 0$. However, there exists an alternative flow
       configuration $X'$ where
       \begin{equation}
       \begin{gathered}
          \forall \left(u, u'\right) \in \mathcal{E} \setminus \{\left(v, w\right), \left(v, T\right)\}, x_{u,u'}' =
          x_{u,u'} \enspace, \\
          x_{vw}' = 0 \mbox{ and} \\
          x_{vT}' = x_{vT} + x_{vw} \enspace,
       \end{gathered}
       \end{equation}
       which is valid because
       \begin{equation}
          \begin{rcases}
             \sum\limits_{w \in N^{+}\left(v\right)}x_{vw} = \sum\limits_{w \in N^{+}\left(v\right)}x_{vw}' \\
             c_{vT} = \infty
          \end{rcases}
          \Rightarrow x_{vT}' \leq c_{vT}
       \end{equation}
       and $X'$ is maximum as well because it carries exactly the same flow as $X$. Thus
       \begin{equation}
          \left(v, w\right) \notin MinCut \enspace.
       \end{equation}
       \qed
    \end{proof}
