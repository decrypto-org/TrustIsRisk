  Trust Is Risk \cite{trustisrisk} proposes a decentralized reputation system. In an effort to deepen our understanding of the
  dynamics of networks created by this construction and to provide useful tools that facilitate the completion of purchases,
  we expand our research in three directions. We firstly describe some games, leveraging approaches from Game Theory.
  Secondly we introduce measures that gauge the health of such networks using the concepts of connectedness and centrality.
  We will finally describe several algorithms that redistribute a player's direct trust in a way that a desired indirect trust
  towards a specific player is achieved.
