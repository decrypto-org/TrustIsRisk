\begin{proof}
   If $T$ chooses the evil strategy and all players in $S$ play according to the conservative strategy, they will have
   to steal all their incoming direct trust since they have suffered an infinite loss, thus they will act in a way
   identical to following the evil strategy as far as $MaxFlow$ is concerned. The theorem follows thus from the Trust
   Flow theorem.
%   \begin{equation}
%      \forall A \in \mathcal{V} \setminus S, Tr_{A \rightarrow T} = maxFlow\left(A, T\right) = Tr_{A \rightarrow S}
%      \enspace.
%   \end{equation}
\end{proof}
