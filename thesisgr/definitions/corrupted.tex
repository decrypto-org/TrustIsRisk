\begin{definitiongr}{Corrupted Set}
  Let $\mathcal{G}$ be a game graph and let Eve have a set of players $\mathcal{B} \subset \mathcal{V}$ corrupted, so
  that she fully controls their outgoing direct trusts to any player in $\mathcal{V}$ and can also steal all incoming
  direct trust to players in $\mathcal{B}$. We call this the corrupted set. The players $\mathcal{B}$ are considered to
  be legitimate before the corruption, thus they may be directly trusted by any player in $\mathcal{V}$.
