\section{Introduction}
  Online marketplaces can be categorized as centralized and decentralized.
  Two examples of each category are \href{http://www.ebay.com}{ebay} and \href{https://openbazaar.org/}{OpenBazaar}.
  The common denominator of established online marketplaces is that the reputation of each vendor and client is typically
  expressed in the form of stars and user-generated reviews that are viewable by the whole network.

  Our goal is to create a reputation system for decentralized marketplaces where the trust each user gives to the rest of
  the users is quantifiable in monetary terms. The central assumption used throughout this paper
  is that trust is equivalent to risk, or the proposition that $Alice$'s \textit{trust} to another user $Charlie$ is defined
  to be the \textit{maximum sum of money} that $Alice$ can lose when $Charlie$ is free to choose any strategy he wants. To
  flesh out this concept, we will use \textit{lines of credit} as proposed by Washington Sanchez \cite{loc}. $Alice$ joins
  the network by explicitly entrusting a certain amount of money to another user, say her friend, $Bob$. If $Bob$ has already
  entrusted an amount of money to a third user, $Charlie$, then $Alice$ indirectly trusts $Charlie$ since if the latter
  wished to play unfairly, he could have already stolen the money entrusted to him by $Bob$. We will later see that $Alice$
  can now engage in economic interaction with $Charlie$.

  To implement lines-of-credit, we use Bitcoin \cite{bitcoin}, a decentralized cryptocurrency that differs from conventional
  currencies in that it does not depend on trusted third parties. All transactions are public as they are recorded on a
  decentralized ledger, the blockchain. Each transaction takes some coins as input and produces some coins as output. If the
  output of a transaction is not connected to the input of another, then this output belongs to the UTXO, the set of unspent
  transaction output. The UTXO contains all coins not yet spent.

  We propose a new kind of wallet where coins are not stored locally, but are placed in shared accounts materialized through
  1-of-2 multisigs, a bitcoin construction that permits any one of two pre-designated users to spend the coins contained
  within a shared account \cite{masteringbitcoin}. We will use the notation 1/$\{Alice, Bob\}$ to represent a 1-of-2
  multisig that can be spent by either $Alice$ or $Bob$. In this notation, the order of usernames is irrelevant, as either
  user can spend. However, the user who deposits the money initially into the shared account is relevant -- she is the one
  risking her money.

  Our approach changes the user experience in a subtle but drastic way. A user no more has to base her trust towards a
  store on stars or ratings which are not expressed in financial units. She can simply consult her wallet to decide whether
  the store is trustworthy and, if so, up to what value, denominated in bitcoin. This system works as follows: Initially
  $Alice$ migrates her funds from her private bitcoin wallet to 1-of-2 multisig addresses shared with friends she
  comfortably trusts. We call this direct trust. Our system is agnostic to the means players use to determine who is
  trustworthy for these direct 1-of-2 deposits. In our system this dubious kind of trust is confined to the direct
  neighbourhood of each player; indirect trust towards unknown users is calculated by a deterministic algorithm. For
  comparison, systems with global ratings do not distinguish between neighbours and other users, thus offering dubious trust
  indications for everyone.

  Suppose that $Alice$ is viewing the item listings of vendor $Charlie$. Instead of $Charlie$'s stars, $Alice$ will see a
  positive value that is calculated by her wallet and represents the maximum monetary value that $Alice$ can safely use to
  complete a purchase from $Charlie$. We examine exactly how this value, known as indirect trust, is calculated in Trust
  Flow theorem (\ref{trustflow}). It is important to note here that indirect trust to a specific user is not global but
  subjective; each user views a personalized indirect trust based on the network topology. The indirect trust reported by
  our system maintains the following desired security property: If $Alice$ makes a purchase from $Charlie$, then she is
  exposed to no more risk than she was already taking willingly. The existing voluntary risk is exactly that which $Alice$
  was taking by sharing her coins with her trusted friends. We prove this result in the Risk Invariance theorem
  (\ref{riskinv}). Obviously it will not be safe for $Alice$ to buy anything from $Charlie$ or any other vendor if she has
  not directly entrusted any value to any other user.

  We see that in Trust Is Risk the money is not invested at the time of the purchase and directly to the vendor, but at an
  earlier point in time and only to parties that are trustworthy for out of band reasons. The fact that this system can
  function in a completely decentralized fashion will become clear in the following sections. We prove this result in the
  Sybil Resilience theorem (\ref{sybil}).

  Observe that we make the design choice that one can express her trust maximally in terms of her available capital. Thus,
  an impoverished player cannot allocate much direct trust to her friends, no matter how trustworthy they are. On the other
  hand, a rich player may entrust a small fraction of her funds to a player that she does not find trustworthy to a great
  extent and still exhibit more direct trust than the impoverished player of the previous example does. There is no upper
  limit to trust; each player is only limited by her funds. We thus take advantage of the following remarkable property of
  money: To normalise subjective human preferences into objective value.

  There are several incentives for a user to join this network. First of all, she can have access to a store that is
  otherwise inaccessible. Moreover, two friends can formalize their mutual trust by directly entrusting the same amount to
  each other. A large company that casually subcontracts other companies to complete various tasks can express its trust
  towards them using this method. A government can choose to directly entrust its citizens with money and confront them using
  a corresponding legal arsenal if they make irresponsible use of this trust. A bank can provide loans as outgoing and
  manage savings as incoming direct trust. Last but not least, the network can be viewed as a possible field for investment
  and speculation since it constitutes a completely new area for financial activity.

  It is worth noting that the same physical person can maintain multiple pseudonymous identities in the same trust network
  and that multiple independent trust networks for different purposes can coexist. On the other hand, the same pseudonymous
  identity can be used to establish trust in different contexts.
