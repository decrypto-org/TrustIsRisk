\section{Evolution of Trust}
  \subimport{fc17/definitions/}{turns.tex}
  We use $prev\left(j\right)$ and $next\left(j\right)$ to denote the previous and next turn respectively played by
  $Player(j)$. %A formal definition is in the Appendix.

  Knowledge of the initial graph $\mathcal{G}_0$, all players' initial capital and the history amount to full comprehension of
  the evolution of the game. Building on the example of figure \ref{fig:utxo}, we can see the resulting graph when $D$ plays
  \begin{equation}
  \label{turnexample}
     Turn_1 = \{Steal\left(1, A\right), Add\left(4, C\right)\} \enspace.
  \end{equation}

  TrustIsRisk is controlled by an algorithm that chooses a player, receives the turn that
  this player wishes to play and, if this turn is valid, executes it. These steps are repeated indefinitely. We assume
  players are chosen in a way that, after her turn, a player will eventually play again later.

  \texttt{strategy[}$v$\texttt{]()} provides player $v$ with full knowledge of the game, except for the capitals of other
  players. This assumption may not be realistic because out of band knowledge and traffic analysis methods can be used to
  infer the capital of other players.

  \texttt{executeTurn()} checks the validity of \texttt{Turn} and substitutes it with an empty turn if invalid.
  Subsequently, it creates the new graph $\mathcal{G}_j$ and updates the history accordingly. For the routine code,
  see the Appendix.
