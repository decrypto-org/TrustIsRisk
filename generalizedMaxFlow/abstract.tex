  Previous versions of Trust is Risk present the Conservative and the Idle strategy as distinct and unrelated. This work is an
  attempt to generalize this idea into a continuous spectrum of strategies, the two ends of which correspond to the two
  previously defined strategies. Prior to querying the system for an indirect trust towards Bob, Alice can attribute a specific
  expected strategy to each one of the participating players, or even fine-tune the response of each player to a steal action
  of each one of the players she directly trusts. The system then executes the generalized MaxFlow to determine the indirect
  trust from Alice to Bob, given the specified strategies of the rest of the players.
